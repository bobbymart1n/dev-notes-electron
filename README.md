# Dev Notes

The idea behind this app is specifically for devs to take notes on. Some of the
feature ideas include:

- General Note taking
- Snippet support with Syntax Highlighting
- Base level calendar viewing
- Base level Kanban style board in the app

Those are just some quick things off the top of my head for an MVP but happy to
elaborate more in the future. This is just a dump of initial thoughts to get
them out of my head.

# Scripts

To run the project use the `dev` script

```
npm run dev
```

Right now this is the only script available other than a boilerplate test script

# Technologies

The app is built with Electron and React (as of this writing React hasn't been
installed yet). For the backend I was thinking of going a node based GraphQL
service that uses a NoSQL DB to handle all saving of datas
